        <h2 class="bio-headers">My background</h2>

        <h3 class="bio-headers">CrowdStrike</h3>
        <p>
            For the past 2.5 years, I worked at CrowdStrike as a Data Solution Architect in the company's Commerce business organization. In this role I supported the definition and implementation of system-level data requirements across risk evaluation, checkout, and product provisioning infrastructure that enables businesses to automatically trial and purchase CrowdStrike software online.
        </p>

        <p>
            With my background in Privacy, I developed a strong relationship with CrowdStrike's Privacy Legal team and served as the Commerce Organization's main point of contact to support reviews of new data processing activities. The Privacy Legal team onboarded me as a OneTrust admin to run privacy reviews and document data processing work in CrowdStrike's Register of Processing Activity. Leaning on my technical training, I worked to enhance existing surveys and developed a new product-privacy survey that is used company-wide in the privacy review process. The enhancements and the new survey I produced with the Privacy Legal team focused on improving technical documentation to support the implementation and evaluation of privacy controls.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bio-headers">Privacy Engineering Master's</h3>
        <p>
            Before joining CrowdStrike, I was a master's student in Privacy Engineering at Carnegie Mellon where I focused on various components of privacy policy and law, privacy enhancing
            technologies, and the design of usable tools that help individuals recognize privacy and security concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main research project was the development of a software tool called <i>Privacy Label Wiz</i> (see <a
                href="https://doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW55150.2022.00028">publication</a>, see <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/news/2023/03/29-privacy-label-wiz.html">press release</a> )
            that helps iOS application developers generate more accurate <a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">privacy labels</a>.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="bio-headers">CFPB</h3>
        <p>
            Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov">Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau</a> with Economists and Psychologists in the Decision-Making and Behavioral Studies section in the Bureau's Office of Research.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a great opportunity to build my research and data analysis skillsets while catering to my interests in consumer behavior and experimental research that I developed during undergraduate studies in math and economics at Gettysburg College.
