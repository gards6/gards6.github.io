        <p class="bio">I'm a masterâ€™s student in <a href="https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu">Privacy Engineering</a> at Carnegie
            Mellon University.</p>
    
        <p>
            At Carnegie Mellon, I focus on various components of privacy policy and law, privacy enhancing
            technologies,
            and the design of usable tools that help individuals recognize privacy and security concerns.
            I'm currently working on developing a software tool called <a
                href="https://doi.org/10.1109/EuroSPW55150.2022.00028"><i>Privacy Label Wiz</i></a>
            to help iOS application developers generate more accurate <a
                href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">privacy labels</a>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I'm interested in helping individuals adopt technologies to protect their privacy and integrating
            privacy into the development of products and systems that involve personal data.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov">Consumer Financial
                Protection Bureau</a> with Economists and Psychologists in the Decision-Making and Behavioral Studies
            section.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Before the CFPB, I studied mathematical economics at Gettysburg College where I developed my interest in
            consumer behavior and experimental research.
